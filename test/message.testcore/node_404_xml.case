# Adding a request X-Error-Format: xml header would normally result in the
# error being returned in an XML document, and the return status being 200 OK.
# This is mainly a legacy thing to handle clients (e.g: Flash) which weren't
# able to handle HTTP statuses other than 200 and 404.
#
# HOWEVER, that seems to be bypassed for 404s, which ignore the X-Error-Format
# header.
